                                                Introduction to Web Scraping

                                                Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves making requests to a website's server, retrieving the HTML content, and then parsing and extracting the necessary information. 
Example: Consider a website listing products. A web scraper could extract data like product names, prices, and reviews, automating the process that would otherwise be done manually.

                                                  Understanding HTTP Requests and Responses

GET and POST Requests:
    GET Request:  A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. It appends data to the URL and is often used for reading data from a web page. 
        Example: Fetching the HTML content of a webpage. 
    POST Request: A POST request is used to send data to the server, often resulting in a change on the server. It is commonly used for submitting form data. 
        Example: Logging into a website by submitting a username and  
        
 HTTP Status Codes: 
    2xx: Success Codes: 
        200 OK: The request was successful. 
        204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to return. 
    3xx: Redirection Codes: 
        301 Moved Permanently: The resource has been moved to a different URL. 
        302 Found: Temporary redirect; often used when resources are temporarily moved. 
        304 Not Modified: Indicates that the resource has not changed since the last request. 
    4xx: Client Error Codes: 
        401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided. 
        403 Forbidden: The server understands the request, but refuses to authorize it. 
        404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found. 
        402 Payment Required: Reserved for future use, often seen in subscription-based services. 
    5xx: Server Error Codes: 
        500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message for unexpected conditions. 
        502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from the upstream server. 
        503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request.
